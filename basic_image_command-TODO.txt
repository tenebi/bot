1. get input from user (!weeb)
2. have an index of weeb themed images (folder, each image is named with an unsigned int starting at 0)
3. roll a random number between 0 and max image count
4. output weeb image

post scriptum : this can then later be cannibalised to create !pat, !slap, !suckdick etc commands
